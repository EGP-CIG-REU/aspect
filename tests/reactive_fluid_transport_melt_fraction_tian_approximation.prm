# This test checks that the tian approximation reaction model correctly 
# outputs the melt fractions. The initial bound water is 1 wt%, and there is
# also an initial porosity of 1% (volume fraction). 
# The pressure is 1 GPa, and the temperature is set to 1600 K, and the solid
# is 100% peridotite. The tian approximation says that the peridotite can only
# store 0.10257 wt% water. The melt fraction within the tian reaction model is calculated with:
# m_f = wt%_bound_water + wt%_free_water - equilibrium_water_content
# So we need to compute the wt%_free_water. The porosity is a volume fraction,
# so we just need to convert it to a mass fraction with:
# wt%_free_water = porosity * rho_f / rho_b
# We use a fluid density of 2000 kg/m^3 and a solid density of 3000 kg/m^3, so the
# bulk density rho_b is equal to:
# rho_b = (1 - porosity) * rho_s + porosity * rho_f = 2990 kg/m^3.
# This results in an initial wt%_free_water equal to 0.0066889. Therefore, we can
# determine that the melt fraction output should be equal to:
# m_f = 0.01 + 0.0066889 - 0.0010257 = 0.0156632.
