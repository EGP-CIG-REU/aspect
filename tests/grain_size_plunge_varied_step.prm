# A test for the grain size material model using the pinned state damage formulation.
# This test is like the grain_size_plunge test, but modifies the ODE solver parameters
# to check that they are working as intended. At the time of writing the test, the ODE
# statistics postprocessor reports 3 steps for the default values, and 5 steps
# for the parameters in this file. Using an initial step size of 1.0 results in 1 step.
