Added: A cookbook that demonstrates how to govern
phase transformations using a non-equilibrium thermodynamic
formulation for calculating reaction rates (using operator
splitting). The simple subduction model shows a dynamic
metastable olivine layer forming near the olivine -->
wadsleyite phase transition.
