New: The geometric multigrid (GMG) solver now also supports running
without viscosity averaging. This has the same memory requirement and
computational cost per iteration as Q1 averaging. Note that we still
need to average the viscosity for the GMG hierarchy, which likely
results in higher iteration counts compared to computations with
viscosity averaging enabled.
