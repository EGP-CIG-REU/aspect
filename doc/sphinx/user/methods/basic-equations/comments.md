# Comments on the final set of equations

ASPECT solves the equations given in the previous sections in essentially the form stated.
In particular, the form given in {math:numref}`eq:stokes-1` implies that the pressure $p$ we compute is in fact the *total pressure*, i.e., the
sum of hydrostatic pressure and dynamic pressure (however, see {ref}`sec:methods:static-v-dynamic` for more information on this, as well as the extensive discussion of this issue in {cite:t}`kronbichler:etal:2012`).
Consequently, it allows the direct use of this pressure when looking up pressure dependent material parameters.
